Attractor learning for spatiotemporally chaotic dynamical
systems using Echo-State Networks with Transfer Learning
============================================================================================

Summary
-------
This repository accompanies the research paper titled: "Attractor learning for spatiotemporally 
chaotic dynamical systems using Echo-State Networks with Transfer Learning" 

In this paper, we use Echo State Networks (ESNs), a type of Reservoir Computing model, 
to predict the dynamics of the generalized Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (gKS) equation. 
The gKS equation is known for its chaotic behavior and sensitivity to parameter changes.
Our method combines ESNs with Transfer Learning to adapt predictions across different parameter regimes. 
We show that retraining an ESN using a small new dataset improves performance significantly compared to training from scratch.
